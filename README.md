# Digital-Clock

i am a begginer in js, so for the practice purpose i created this project using some html css and maximum part of JavaScript.
i have tried to make it real time responsive. Its for the Newton School also to consider myself a good programmer 
and i thanks ti Newton School for giving me this opportunity and making me worth making the projects like this.
